    <p>
    Whats Up ! My name is Kameron most people call me Kam. I have way too many nicknames just depends on who you ask. I dont know why I guess just how it goes. I am 21 years young,yes I have no misceptions about being old physically. I enjoy alot of things from basketball, to anime, to reading the bible or just going for a walk to enjoy the beautiful day. I enjoy making people laugh and feel better. So if my joke sounds whack but you still laugh I did my job. I want to learn all i can from this course so i can get a job to support myself so I can stop relaying on people for help.I live pretty simple, so I believe if your real and honest with people that is what you will recevive back more often then not. Aside from that pretty open book, ask me whats up and I will answer it as honest as possible.
